%SG_FILTERWITHBANK2 - Gabor filtering with filterbank
%
% r = sg_filterwithbank2(s, bank)
%
% Filter 2D signal using a filterbank. 
%
%   s - signal (image)
%   bank - filterbank, created with sg_createfilterbank()
%
% Optional arguments are
%   max_zoom  - Maximum scaling to be used with method 1. Will be used 
%               only if lower than scaling factor based on highest 
%               frequency of the filter. Default 0 means that the
%               image will be downscaled as much as possible.
%
% Response structure includes
%   .N      - the size of the filtered image
%   .freq   - a cell array of filter responses which contains fields
%      .f    - frequency of the filter
%      .zoom - scaling factor at with this filter frequency (currently
%              always the same as the same field in the main structure)
%      .resp - actual filter responses, [N x X x Y] matrix where 
%              N is number of filter orientations and X and Y are
%              the response resolution
%   .zoom       - integer factor of how much the image was downscaled 
%                 during filtering for each filter frequency
%   .respSize   - the resolution of responses for each filter frequency
%   .actualZoom - actual scaling factors for x and y directions, may differ
%                 slightly to .zoom for each filter frequency
%
% This is an alternate version of SG_FILTERWITHBANK which computes
% responses of each filter frequency scaled to as low resolution as
% possible. Amplitudes of responses are normalized (unlike with
% SG_FILTERWITHBANK). 
%
% Note that other functions working with response structure 
% returned by SG_FILTERWITHBANK do not work because the resolutions
% are not the same for all filters.
